								<p> The processor, also known as the CPU, provides the instructions and processing power the computer needs to do its work. The more powerful and updated your processor, the faster your computer can complete its tasks..</p>
								<p>There are different types of processors.</p>
						    	<p>1-Microprocessor</p>
								<p>The fundamental process of the system is denoted by a microprocessor incorporated in the embedded systems. There are various types of microprocessors in the market implemented by different enterprises. The microprocessor is a standard processor which comprises of ALU, control unit and club of registers known as control registers, status registers, and scratchpad registers.</p>
								<p>A one or two microprocessor can be merged together to form a multiprocessor. The input and output operations and memory are shared by the processors. The access time in the memory register is similar for every processor and every processor are associated by bus. The working and access and their input and output functions are mutually shared by the processor to perform the same function.</p>
								<p>2-Microcontroller</p>
								<p>The microcontroller is standard which is available in different size and packages. The input reading and reacting to its corresponding output is the fundamental function of the basic microcontroller and so it is called as general-purpose input and output processors (GPIO). Few of the microcontrollers are Microchip P1C16F877A, Microchip Atmega328, Microchip P1C18F45K22, Microchip P1C16F671, and Microchip P1C16F1503.</p>
								<p>3-Embedded Processor</p>
								<p>The embedded processor is structured to control the electrical and mechanical functions. It comprises of numerous blocks like timer, program memory, data memory, reset, power supply, data memory, interrupt controller, clock oscillator systems, interfacing circuits, specific circuits and system application ports and circuits.</p>
								<p>4-Digital Signal Processor</p>
								<p>The digital signal processor is used for filtering, measuring, compressing analogue and digital signals. The processing of signal means that manipulation and analysis of digital signals. This process can be made using application specified integration circuits, digital signal processor, field-programmable gate array or it can be a computer to achieve a distinct signal. The processors in DSP are used for barcode scanners, oscilloscope, printers, mobile phones. These processors are used for rapid and implied for real-time applications.</p>

								<p>2-Arithmetic logic unit</p>
								<p>It performs arithmetic and logical operations (decisions). The ALU is where calculations are done and where decisions are made.
								   It acts as a gateway between primary memory and secondary storage . Data transferred between them passes through the ALU.

							    </p>
								<p>3-Registers</p>
								<p>Registers are small amounts of high-speed memory contained within the CPU. They are used by the processor to store small amounts of data that are needed during processing, such as:

                               
                                    1. The address of the next instruction to be executed.
									2. The current instruction being decoded.
									3. The results of calculations.

								</p>
								<p>4-Cache</p>
								<p>Cache is a small amount of high-speed random access memory (RAM) built directly within the processor. It is used to temporarily hold data and instructions that the processor is likely to reuse. This allows for faster processing as the processor does not have to wait for the data and instructions to be fetched from the RAM.</p>
								<p>5-Buses</p>
								<p>A bus is a high-speed internal connection. Buses are used to send control signals and data between the processor and other components.</p>
							    <p>Three types of bus of are:</p>
								<p>(a) Address bus - carries memory addresses from the processor to other components such as primary memory and input/output devices.</p>
								<p>(b) Data bus - carries the actual data between the processor and other components.</p>
							    <p>(c) Control bus - carries control signals from the processor to other components. The control bus also carries the clock's pulses.</p>
								<p>6-Clock</p>
								<p>The CPU contains a clock which is used to coordinate all of the computer's components. The clock sends out a regular electrical pulse which synchronises (keeps in time) all the components.</p>
								<p>The frequency of the pulses is known as the clock speed. Clock speed is measured in hertz. The higher the frequency, the more instructions can be performed in any given moment of time.</p>
								<p>In the 1980s, processors commonly ran at a rate of between 3 megahertz (MHz) to 5 MHz, which is 3 million to 5 million pulses or cycles per second. Today, processors commonly run at a rate of 3 gigahertz (GHz) to 5 GHz, which is 3 billion to 5 billion pulses or cycles per second.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Ram</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Swissbit_2GB_PC2-5300U-555.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<P>RAM stands for random-access memory, but what does that mean? Your computer RAM is essentially short term memory where data is stored as the processor needs it. This isn't to be confused with long-term data that's stored on your hard drive, which stays there even when your computer is turned off.</P>
								<P>RAM contains multiplexing and demultiplexing circuitry, to connect the data lines to the addressed storage for reading or writing the entry. Usually more than one bit of storage is accessed by the same address, and RAM devices often have multiple data lines and are said to be "8-bit" or "16-bit", etc. devices.</P>
								<p>In today's technology, random-access memory takes the form of integrated circuit (IC) chips with MOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor) memory cells. RAM is normally associated with volatile types of memory (such as dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) modules), where stored information is lost if power is removed, although non-volatile RAM has also been developed.[3] Other types of non-volatile memories exist that allow random access for read operations, but either do not allow write operations or have other kinds of limitations on them. These include most types of ROM and a type of flash memory called NOR-Flash.</p>
								<p>The two main types of volatile random-access semiconductor memory are static random-access memory (SRAM) and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM).</p>
								<P>SRAM (static RAM) is a type of random access memory (RAM) that retains data bits in its memory as long as power is being supplied.</P>
								<P>SRAM is commonly used for a computer's cache memory, such as a processor's L2 or L3 cache. It is not used for a computer's main memory because of its cost and size. Most computers use DRAM instead because it supports greater densities at a lower cost per megabyte (MB). However, SRAM is often used for other general-purpose.</P>
								<P>DRAM stands for “dynamic random access memory,” and it's a specific type of RAM (random access memory). All computers have RAM, and DRAM is one kind of RAM we see in modern desktops and laptops. DRAM was invented in 1968 by Robert Dennard and put to market by Intel® in the '70s .</P>

								<P>As you can see in left side there is Nvme m.2 SSD and in right side there is Hard Disk</P>
								<p>But do you know what is the diffeence between ssd and hdd?</p>
								<P>SSDs are a form of storage media that saves persistent data on solid-state flash memory.And SSD is faster than Hard disk drive(hdd). The m.2ssd is a type of ssd which is way better and faster than all previous version of ssd it can have speed of 7000mbps data transfer rateor read rate . The M. 2 SSD interface specification was originally known as the Next-Generation Form Factor, but the name was changed to M</P>
								<P>Hard disk the hard drive is where all your permanent computer data is stored. Whenever you save a file, photo, or software to your computer, it's stored in your hard drive.This is slower than SSD because it has moving parts.</P>

								<P>The motherboard serves as a single platform to connect all of the parts of a computer together. It connects the CPU, memory, hard drives, optical drives, video card, sound card, and other ports and expansion cards directly or via cables. It can be considered as the backbone of a computer.</P>
								<P>Some features of motherboard are :</P>
								<P> MOTHERBOARD is very essential thing to make a complete pc set up because your processor,ram,ssd/hard disk have insert in it .</P>
								<P> A better motherboards allows heavy processors to use it full power to do heavy or very task. </P>
